The name \"OnRespawnClicked\" suggests that this method might be called when the animator detects that the beast has killed the player and the player is being respawned.

      "The `LookAt()` method is typically used in animation and AI systems to make an object or character face a certain direction or target. In this context, it's reasonable to assume that the `LookAt()` method in the `BeastState` class is used to make the beast's head turn towards a specific position. This behavior is often seen in games where creatures have a head that moves independently of their body, and they need to face their enemies or targets to attack or interact with them.\n",
